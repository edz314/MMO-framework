**MMO-Framework**

**Overview**

  The MMO-Framework is a modular and scalable framework designed to handle intelligent NPC (Non-Player Character) behaviors in Massive Multiplayer Online (MMO) games. The framework utilizes Finite State Machines (FSM) and Decision Trees to control NPC behavior, allowing for complex and dynamic interactions within the game world.

**Features:**

  Finite State Machine (FSM): Implements NPC states like Idle, Patrol, Chase, and Attack, with logic for smooth transitions between them.
  
  Decision Trees: Provides a system for making NPC decisions based on real-time data, influencing their state transitions and behaviors.
  
  Behavior Profiles: Allows customization of NPC behavior patterns, making it easy to define unique AI for different NPC types.
  
  Data Management: Handles real-time updates to NPC attributes and world state, ensuring responsive and adaptive NPC behavior.

**Installation**

  to do:

**Usage**

  The framework is designed to be easily extended and customized. You can create new NPC behaviors by defining new states and decision nodes, or by modifying the existing behavior profiles.
